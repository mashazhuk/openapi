This project implements a basic JWT-based authentication system.

## Features:
- User registration with email and password
- Login and logout functionality
- Token-based authentication for protected routes
- Middleware to validate user sessions

## Endpoints:
- `POST /api/register` - Create a new user
- `POST /api/login` - Authenticate user and return token
- `GET /api/me` - Fetch authenticated user's profile
- `POST /api/logout` - Invalidate token (optional)

**Note:** Frontend stores token in `localStorage` or cookies for session management.
