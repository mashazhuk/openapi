# Software Requirements Specification (SRS)

## 1. General Description

This system is designed to automatically analyze human speech in order to detect the speaker’s emotional state (e.g., happiness, sadness, anger) using modern speech processing and neural network technologies.

### Objectives:
- Develop an emotion detection engine based on audio input
- Apply machine hearing techniques and acoustic signal analysis
- Implement a REST API to process and return emotional classification results

### Target Users:
- AI and machine learning researchers
- Voice interface developers
- Psychodiagnostics specialists

### Key Features:
- Upload audio recordings (`.wav`, `.mp3`)
- Signal pre-processing (noise removal, normalization)
- Feature extraction (e.g., MFCC, spectrogram)
- Emotion classification using a trained neural network
- JSON output via REST API

### Benefits:
- Enables emotion-aware systems
- Improves human-computer interaction
- Supports accessibility and assistive technologies

## 2. Functional Requirements

| ID | Description |
|----|-------------|
| FR-1 | User uploads an audio file in supported formats |
| FR-2 | System applies signal cleaning and normalization |
| FR-3 | Feature extraction (MFCCs, pitch, energy, spectrogram) |
| FR-4 | Neural network classifies emotional state |
| FR-5 | Result returned as JSON with emotion and confidence score |

### Inputs:
- Audio file (WAV/MP3)

### Outputs:
- JSON result: `{ "emotion": "happy", "confidence": 0.87 }`

### Measurement Units:
- Amplitude, frequency (Hz), time (s)

### Valid Ranges:
- Audio length: ≤ 10 seconds
- File size: ≤ 1 MB

---

## 3. Interface Requirements

### Internal Interfaces:
- Signal Preprocessing → Feature Extraction → Emotion Classifier (Pipeline communication)

### External Interfaces:
- REST API:
  - `POST /analyze` → accepts audio file, returns result
  - `GET /emotions` → returns list of supported emotions

### Protocols and Formats:
- Communication: HTTP
- Format: JSON
- Implementation Language: Python 3.10+

## 4. Performance Requirements

### Execution Performance:
- Max response time: 3 seconds for ≤10s audio
- Memory usage: ≤300MB per request
- Classification accuracy: ≥85%

### Static Requirements:
- Support only `.wav` and `.mp3` formats

### Dynamic Requirements:
- Ready for real-time audio streaming extension
